Q. Pragha does not play certain audio file.
A. Pragha adds new audio formats on a par with taglib.
   If compiled with taglib = 1.4, pragha support ogg, flac, mpeg, wav
   and all variants. If taglib = 1.6 add support to asf, wma and m4a.
   If taglib >= 1.7 also support ape files.
   Then you need to install the gstreamer codecs needed to play them.
   In general installing gstreamer-plugins-bad and gstreamer-plugins-ugly
   you can play all files.
